[theExpeditionarium](https://github.com/rapidExpedition/theExpeditionarium/wiki) maintains a central hub for the public, collaborative development of the concept of [Rapid Expedition](https://www.rapidexpedition.org/rapidexpedition/).  It provides the front-end for the explication of the *expeditionary philosophy* at the core of that concept but also that of the many potential facets of the practice of that philosophy.

The Expeditionarium's website, [rapidexpedition.org](https://www.rapidexpedition.org/), is a [static site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page) which is deployed rapidly from this repository, the details of which are available on the site's [wiki](https://github.com/rapidExpedition/theExpeditionarium/wiki).  The content contained here-in represents that of the site and its functions and to no great extent is any of the relevant text of this project generated or otherwise maintained here.  All such content as might be found on the site itself is retrieved from other repositories via submodules in the `_includes` directory; all of which fall under the administration of our [organization](https://github.com/rapidExpedition) and are included in our project's [super repository](https://github.com/rapidExpedition/rapidExpedition).  Again, more details are available in the [wiki](https://github.com/rapidExpedition/theExpeditionarium/wiki).
