The archaic dichotomy of mind and body is one which manifests most tellingly in the deep divide between intellectual and physical pursuits evident across cultures.  To some extent is this divide integral to the demands of particular labors and the dimensions of their utility to society.  Certainly when it comes to budgeting one's time toward becoming specialized in one pursuit or another might one understandably do so at the expense of all else--particularly forgoing whatever might seem diametrically opposed to such specialization.

And yet we find in the most noble or admirable modes of living a distinct balance between the two: a sort of "harmony of pen and sword"<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup> in which a rich intellectual life might guide one's physical endeavors and, by virtue of such, even develop one's physical form.  Here, we will focus on the latter though, not unsurprisingly, as it relates to endeavor in action as well as habit or routine.

In short, we seek here for a coherent intellectualization of life and limb at the most fundamental level.

## Articulations
Here are listed some efforts toward articulating the *mode of rapid expedition* as it relates to physical form and function:

* [Prana Bindu](/wayPoint/pranaBindu) प्राण बिंदु
  > A tripartite approach toward formulating a complete and well-rounded physical training regimen with emphasis upon the importance of strength, particularly to the extent that it contributes to the development of martial prowess.
