This wiki represents an attempt to establish and develop a set of philosophical principles collaboratively, employing appropriate technologies for ease of communication and distribution.  Here, we will specifically survey the novel concept of [Expeditionary Philosophy](expeditionaryPhilosophy.md) and more specifically, the notion of [Rapid Expedition](rapidExpedition/About.md) as a modern cultural paradigm.  The goal is to pioneer a comprehensive and relevant philosophy to benefit the modern age in practice and prescription.  As this wiki will remain open-source, its development will be public, and its contents available for copy and alteration.
