This work represents an attempt to establish and develop a set of philosophical principles collaboratively by employing appropriate technologies for ease of communication and distribution.  Here, we will specifically survey the novel concept of [Expeditionary Philosophy]() and more specifically, the notion of [Rapid Expedition](), as a modern cultural paradigm to be honed.  The goal is to pioneer a comprehensive and relevant philosophy to benefit the modern age in practice and prescription.  As this work will remain open-source, its development will be public, and its contents available for copy and alteration.

## How to Contribute

The simplest means of contribution would be to visit this document's [home on gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com/book/rapidexpedition/rapidexpedition/) and offer [commentary inline in discussion](https://www.gitbook.com/blog/features/discussions).

Contributing more directly is somewhat advanced:  It is necessary to first [clone](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository#Cloning-an-Existing-Repository) the [repository](https://github.com/rapidExpedition/rapidExpedition) in order to submit or edit articles here.  It is recommended to do so in this manner:

```git clone --recursive https://github.com/rapidExpedition/rapidExpedition.git```

This work relies on [git](http://git-scm.com/) versioning, distribution, and collaboration as well as [markdown syntax](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).  The wiki itself is generated by [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com), so it would behoove a contributor to peruse through its [documentation](https://help.gitbook.com/).

It is also recommendable that one [try git](http://try.github.com/) before diving in, but it is possible to edit any article directly through [github](https://github.com/) without cloning or alternatively through [GitBook's own editor](https://www.gitbook.com/editor); however, authorship is like any other craft and benefits from use of [appropriate tools](https://github.com/karthik/markdown_science/wiki/Tools-to-support-your-markdown-authoring).

## Why to Contribute

This work exists for the purpose of establishing permanent and permanently evolving guidelines for the essential tasks which befall a modern citizen of the global community.  It is for the development of proficiency in those tasks as well as to explore and discover just what sort of tasks a productive and proficient life might entail.  In short we are after a characterization of a complete and competent stewardship of life and civilization at large.

Written language is a well-established means of conveying ideas, and when ideas are shared and shaped collectively, they affect the development and history of the world at large.  Thus, a concise and adaptive expression of ideas with substantial and universal utility could achieve a lasting and manageable legacy.
