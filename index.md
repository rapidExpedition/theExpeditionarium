Welcome to the Expeditionarium
==============

This wiki represents an attempt to establish and develop a set of philosophical principles collaboratively, employing appropriate technologies for ease of communication and distribution.  Here, we will specifically survey the novel concept of [Expeditionary Philosophy](expeditionaryPhilosophy.md) and more specifically, the notion of [Rapid Expedition](rapidExpedition/About.md) as a modern cultural paradigm.  The goal is to pioneer a comprehensive and relevant philosophy to benefit the modern age in practice and prescription.  As this wiki will remain open-source, its development will be public, and its contents available for copy and alteration.

##How to Contribute
It is necessary to first [clone](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository#Cloning-an-Existing-Repository) the [repository](https://github.com/rapidExpedition/theExpeditionarium) in order to submit or edit articles here.  This wiki relies on [git](http://git-scm.com/) versioning, distribution, and collaboration as well as [markdown syntax](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).  The wiki itself is generated by [MDwiki](www.mdwiki.info/), so it would behoove a contributor to peruse through its [documentation](http://dynalon.github.io/mdwiki/#!quickstart.md).  It is recommendable that one [try git](http://try.github.com/) before diving in, but it is possible to edit any article directly through [github](https://github.com/) without cloning; however, authorship is like any other craft and benefits from use of [appropriate tools](https://github.com/karthik/markdown_science/wiki/Tools-to-support-your-markdown-authoring).  For further reference see [rapidExpedition.pub](rapidExpedition/pubSum.md).

##Why to Contribute
This wiki exists for the purpose of establishing permanent and permanently evolving guidelines for the essential tasks which befall a modern citizen of the global community.  It is for the development of proficiency in those tasks as well as to explore and discover just what sort of tasks a productive and proficient life might entail.  In short we are after a characterization of a complete and competent stewardship of life and civilization at large.

The written language is a well-established means of conveying ideas, and when ideas are shared and shaped collectively, they impact the development and history of the world at large.  Thus, a concise and adaptive expression of ideas with substantial and universal utility could achieve a manageable impact.
