The work represented here is an attempt to establish and develop a set of philosophical principles and to do so collaboratively by employing appropriate technologies for ease of communication and distribution.  Here, we will specifically survey the novel concept of [Expeditionary Philosophy]() and more specifically, the notion of [Rapid Expedition](), as a modern cultural paradigm to be honed in service of one and all among mankind.

The goal is to pioneer a comprehensive philosophical mode by which to benefit the modern age in practice and prescription.  As this work will remain [open-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_movement#Beyond_software), its development will be public, and its contents available for copy and alteration.
