**wayPoint** is a virtual incubator for ideas and collaboration.  It is a place to propose and develop ideas openly and publicly in order to attract talent or inspire further development.  The ideas proposed here should ideally range from from small to impoosibly grand, but all of them should aim to improve some aspect of culture or society or human potential in general.
