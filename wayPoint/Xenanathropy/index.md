Among those most curious proclivities of the human organism is the longing to itself surpassed or overcome and most particularly by something of its own creation.  This was perhaps first and best pronounced by Friedrich Nietzsche's *Zarathustra* who heralded the so-called Übermensch<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup>.  More recently have we been given to a notion, at once more imaginative as more banal than the Nietzschean conception, which is referred to by the transhumanist faction of modern futurists as the *posthuman*.

Some cursory research might reveal the two notions as often erroneously conflated with one-another as vehemently juxtaposed.  The parallels are perhaps as undeniable as intrinsic to their likely shared lineage or descendence in their historical sequence.  It is feasible, therefor, that we might derive some common thread between the two by which to reconcile their more idiosyncratic nuances into an ultimately more sturdy and virile notion.

For our purposes in this might we aptly refer to that hypothetical common thread as ***Xenanthropy***, or that from which proceeds the *Xenanthrop*<sup id="a2">[2](#f2)</sup>.

#TODO: explain the use of *xen-* versus *post-* or *neo-*, for instance, particularly as it derives from Nietzsche's conception of the Übermensch as a being not fully understandable or relatable (really, wholly alien) from the limits of a human perspective nor relating to a *human, all too human* perspective. id:11
#TODO: explain the proposed method of developing/exploring Xenanthropy by means of a single collaborative and iterative document which might ultimately be published in any number of ways (on [gitbook](https://www.gitbook.com/book/rapidexpedition/xenanthropy/), to start with, but otherwise developed [here](https://github.com/rapidExpedition/Xenanthropy)), but also explain the idea that behind the document will be a more rapidly iterative wiki for that document to reference or otherwise draw off of. id:12
#TODO: explain the manner in which rapidExpedition stands as an onramp to Xenanthropy which is the core and very purpose of the organization. id:13

 1. <small id="f1"> [Übermensch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9Cbermensch) is most popularly recognized by the translation, *superman*, but most literally referred to in English as *overman*, which could perhaps be best understood in every sense that *[overdrive](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/overdrive)* is commonly understood, to include the [mechanical sense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overdrive_(mechanics)) (high efficiency in a state sustained activity). </small> [↩](#a1)
 2. <small id="f2"> One has only to imagine if philanthropy had as its ultimate goal some hypothetical being or state of being called the *philanathrop* for whom a philanthropist is but a herald and precursor.  Or perhaps one might consider what distinction might be made between a misanthrope and a misanthropist with the former being a matter attitude, nature, or personality and the latter being a matter of contrivance or belief. </small> [↩](#a2) </small> [↩](#a2)
