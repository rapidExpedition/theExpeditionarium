This project--under the working title, *rapiDex*--is intended to produce a CMS which incorporates the  key features of [Draft](https://draftin.com/), [Gollum](https://github.com/gollum/gollum), [TiddlyWiki](http://tiddlywiki.com/). This would include a minimalistic interface, git-backed version control, and the ability to load dynamically as a [single page application](http://tiddlywiki.com/#SinglePageApplication) among other aspects from all three and beyond from similar notable applications.

## Why Another CMS? 

The world of content management systems and publishing platforms is diverse and disparate and fraught with divergent notions of what is necessary or not and why. What they all share in common, however, is that they handle all the heavy-lifting involved with making raw content presentable--usually in a published fashion.

Among such systems, we find wiki platforms, the front-end of which straddles the line between static content--typically documentation of some kind--and a content editor; albeit, almost universally in a rather clunky manner of the like typically employed by blogging platforms. In fact, there's often little difference between a blog and a wiki beyond site layout and the slim difference between pages and posts (both of which may also be referred to simply as articles).

The heart of a wiki is its version control system, but just as other aspects of a wiki's interface are baked into its platform the version control likewise gated for exclusive use by that platform.
