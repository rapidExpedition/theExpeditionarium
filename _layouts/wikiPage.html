<!-- #DONE: began the wiki transclusion project using [this approach](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/1303#issuecomment-21067548) as my jumping-off point (though arguably, [this method](https://github.com/shd101wyy/markdown-preview-enhanced/blob/799cfb896e1d8e449fc8686d1b9e9acf6c079a6d/docs/file-imports.md) would be simpler if it worked in Jekyll) +wikiTransclusion id:25 gh:10
#DONE: Utilizing alert templates for WIP pages in the manner illustrated [here](http://idratherbewriting.com/documentation-theme-jekyll/mydoc_alerts.html#) +wikiTransclusion id:36
# DONE: need to generalize this bullshit a bit better.  I've got one idea that can be seen in the [config](/_config.yml) and have numerous attempts to utilize that commented out in [wikiPath](/_includes/wikiPath.html), [repo](/_includes/repo.html), and here, but I haven't found a legal way to do this with liquid yet.  Basically, I would need a generalized YAML frontmatter item in place of our current way of specifying wiki type/path; otherwise I'll just need to separate that into two separate items (the easiest way, really) +wikiTransclusion id:39
# DONE: getting wayPoint settled into its new form as a wiki and am almost done just as soon as I get the generalization crap figured out +wikiTransclusion id:38
# TODO: figure out a way to include an edit icon next to the headings of ancillary content ("Elaboration" and "Articulations", for instance) since it is not contained in the main wiki article and has no path for editing directly from the website.  This may not be so vital to the completion the first round of adaptations for the project. +wikiTransclusion
