<!-- #DONE: began the wiki transclusion project using [this approach](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/1303#issuecomment-21067548) as my jumping-off point (though arguably, [this method](https://github.com/shd101wyy/markdown-preview-enhanced/blob/799cfb896e1d8e449fc8686d1b9e9acf6c079a6d/docs/file-imports.md) would be simpler if it worked in Jekyll) +wikiTransclusion id:25 gh:10
#DONE: Utilizing alert templates for WIP pages in the manner illustrated [here](http://idratherbewriting.com/documentation-theme-jekyll/mydoc_alerts.html#) +wikiTransclusion id:36
# DONE: need to generalize this bullshit a bit better.  I've got one idea that can be seen in the [config](/_config.yml) and have numerous attempts to utilize that commented out in [wikiPath](/_includes/wikiPath.html), [repo](/_includes/repo.html), and here, but I haven't found a legal way to do this with liquid yet.  Basically, I would need a generalized YAML frontmatter item in place of our current way of specifying wiki type/path; otherwise I'll just need to separate that into two separate items (the easiest way, really) +wikiTransclusion id:39
# DONE: getting wayPoint settled into its new form as a wiki and am almost done just as soon as I get the generalization crap figured out +wikiTransclusion id:38
